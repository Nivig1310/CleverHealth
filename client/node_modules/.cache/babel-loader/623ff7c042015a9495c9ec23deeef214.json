Short term stress is usually caused by multiple challenging situations/tasks \n          forced into a short period of time (ex. arguments, running late, stressful work day). Long-term stress is often caused \n          by a change that can't be easily solved and often persists as a result (ex. financial issues, death of a loved one, having a baby)\n        </Accordion.Body>\n      </Accordion.Item>\n      <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"1\">\n        <Accordion.Header>Hallmarks of Stress</Accordion.Header>\n        <Accordion.Body>\n          While stress may manifest differently in each person, there are certain telltale signs such as moodiness, irritability,\n          depression, worry.

Some of these include making the conscious decision to find pockets of relaxation\n          in your schedule and learning to \"log off\" after a certain time of day, regular exercise, eating nutritious food, seeking professional support, engaging in\n          meditation or yoga daily, limiting screen time, and seeking solutions to your problems. Practicing even a few of these will result in a drastic\n          improvement in your sleep, muscle tension, mood, and more.  \n        </Accordion.Body>\n      </Accordion.Item>\n    </Accordion>\n      </Card.Body>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction HealthCard3() {\n  return (\n    <Card style={{ width: '50%' }}>\n      <Card.Body>\n        <Card.Title>DO YOU FEEL WELL RESTED?</Card.Title>\n        <Accordion defaultActiveKey=\"0\">\n      <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"0\">\n        <Accordion.Header>Adequate Rest</Accordion.Header>\n        <Accordion.Body>\n          Sleep is a vital key to a healthy life. Yet, it is probably the most underestimated factor. A good night's sleep is directly linked to\n          stress, ability to focus, metabolism, physical performance, and even immune system function. Lack of adequate rest can even lead to obesity, heart disease, diabetes,\n          and other serious health concerns. Most adults require at least 7 hours of sleep on a regular basis for optimal function. However, the quality of\n          sleep isn't determined simply by hours of sleep. The next section covers the science behind sleep, and what exactly determines the quality of rest.\n        </Accordion.Body>\n      </Accordion.Item>\n      <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"1\">\n        <Accordion.Header>The Science of Sleep</Accordion.Header>\n        <Accordion.Body>\n          The quality of your sleep is determined by the type of sleep you're getting. Your body cycles through two types of sleep: REM \n          and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep is made up of light sleep and deep sleep. Your heart rate and breathing regulate during light sleep, and your body\n          begins restoration in deep sleep. Non-REM sleep is associated with memory and learning. \n\n          Dreaming is often associated with REM sleep, and is often accompanied by rapid eye movement beneath the eye lids. The body becomes paralyzed\n          and brain waves match those when we are awake. The quality of your sleep is determined by the length of time you spend in these cycles.\n        </Accordion.Body>\n      </Accordion.Item>\n      <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"2\">\n        <Accordion.Header>Impove Your Sleep Quality</Accordion.Header>\n        <Accordion.Body>\n          You can improve your quality of sleep by taking specific steps toward increasing your time snoozing and have deeper rest. For example, \n          cutting out caffeine in the evening, spending time away from screens before bed, exercise, avoiding large meals, short naps, and meditation can \n          dramatically improve your sleep. Consistency, however, is key. Your body has a natural circadian rhythm that responds to consistency. \n          Going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time can have a dramatic improvement on your rest. \n        </Accordion.Body>\n      </Accordion.Item>\n    </Accordion>\n      </Card.Body>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction HealthPlan() {\n  console.log(\"Hello\")\n  return (\n    \n    <div>\n        <div className='nutrition'>\n            <h1>Nutrition</h1>\n            <HealthCard className=\"healthplan\"/>\n        </div>\n        <hr />\n        <div className='stress'>\n            <h1>Stress</h1>\n            <HealthCard2 className=\"healthplan\"/>\n        </div>\n        <hr />\n        <div className='sleep'>\n            <h1>Sleep</h1>\n            <HealthCard3 className=\"healthplan\"/>\n        </div>\n        <hr />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default HealthPlan"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,wBAAwB;AAC3C,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,sBAAsB;AACvC,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,6BAA6B;AACjD,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,sBAAsB;AACzC,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,2BAA2B;AACjD,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,iBAAiB;AAAA;AAGlC,SAASC,UAAU,GAAG;EACpB,oBACE,QAAC,IAAI;IAAC,KAAK,EAAE;MAAEC,KAAK,EAAE;IAAM,CAAE;IAAA,uBAC5B,QAAC,IAAI,CAAC,IAAI;MAAA,wBACR,QAAC,IAAI,CAAC,KAAK;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAqD,eAChE,QAAC,SAAS;QAAC,gBAAgB,EAAC,GAAG;QAAA,wBACjC,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAiC,eAClD,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAME;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eACjB,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAyB,eAC1C,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAME;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eACjB,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAgC,eACjD,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA,0YAGoF;cAAG,IAAI,EAAC,sCAAsC;cAAC,MAAM,EAAE,QAAS;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAkB;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QACpK;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACP;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EACE;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACP;AAEX;AAAC,KAtCQD,UAAU;AAwCnB,SAASE,WAAW,GAAG;EACrB,oBACE,QAAC,IAAI;IAAC,KAAK,EAAE;MAAED,KAAK,EAAE;IAAM,CAAE;IAAA,uBAC5B,QAAC,IAAI,CAAC,IAAI;MAAA,wBACR,QAAC,IAAI,CAAC,KAAK;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAuC,eAClD,QAAC,SAAS;QAAC,gBAAgB,EAAC,GAAG;QAAA,wBACjC,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAmC,eACpD,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAKE;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eACjB,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAuC,eACxD,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAIE;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eACjB,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAwC,eACzD,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAKE;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACP;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EACE;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACP;AAEX;AAAC,MApCQC,WAAW;AAsCpB,SAASC,WAAW,GAAG;EACrB,oBACE,QAAC,IAAI;IAAC,KAAK,EAAE;MAAEF,KAAK,EAAE;IAAM,CAAE;IAAA,uBAC5B,QAAC,IAAI,CAAC,IAAI;MAAA,wBACR,QAAC,IAAI,CAAC,KAAK;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAsC,eACjD,QAAC,SAAS;QAAC,gBAAgB,EAAC,GAAG;QAAA,wBACjC,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAiC,eAClD,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAKE;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eACjB,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAwC,eACzD,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAOE;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF,eACjB,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAC,GAAG;UAAA,wBAC1B,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA6C,eAC9D,QAAC,SAAS,CAAC,IAAI;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAKE;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACP;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EACE;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACP;AAEX;AAAC,MAvCQE,WAAW;AAyCpB,SAASC,UAAU,GAAG;EACpBC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAAC,OAAO,CAAC;EACpB,oBAEE;IAAA,wBACI;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;MAAA,wBACtB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAkB,eAClB,QAAC,UAAU;QAAC,SAAS,EAAC;MAAY;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAClC,eACN;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAAM,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAA,wBACnB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAe,eACf,QAAC,WAAW;QAAC,SAAS,EAAC;MAAY;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACnC,eACN;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAAM,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;MAAA,wBAClB;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAc,eACd,QAAC,WAAW;QAAC,SAAS,EAAC;MAAY;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAE;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACnC,eACN;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAAM;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACJ;AAEV;AAAC,MAtBQF,UAAU;AAwBnB,eAAeA,UAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
